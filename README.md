# SauceDemo QA Test Cases Repository

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive set of **manual test cases** for the **SauceDemo E-Commerce Application**.  
The project is designed to demonstrate **real-world QA test case design skills** with a strong focus on **functional, negative, edge-case, security, and backend validation scenarios**.

The repository is intentionally kept **test-case centric**, highlighting depth of testing, coverage, and clarity rather than automation code.
